# anim: a drawing that moves

A drawing's table, then a table `Shape | Keys`: for each moving shape (its row number from 0), keys separated by `; `, each `frame,dx,dy,depth,size,spin[,effects]`: where it is at that frame as an offset in pixels from where it was drawn, its depth (nearer when positive), its size as a scale (1 as drawn), its spin in degrees, and effect letters (`i` impact, `3` 3D, `d` shadow, `n` neon, `o` outline, `g` rainbow, `m` mirror, `w` wobble, `b` blur). Between keys it moves in straight lines. The head holds `frames` (2 to 120), `fps` (1 to 30) and `loop` (`once`, a number, or `bounce`; for ever otherwise).
